During my internship at Infotrixs, I successfully completed a cloud computing and AWS project. I honed my skills in cloud infrastructure management, AWS services, and solution design, contributing valuable insights to the team's projects. This experience strengthened my expertise in the ever-evolving field of cloud technology.
